# DevSecOps - CI

This project focuses on enhancing the security of DevOps environments by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The primary goal is to automate tasks like threat detection, vulnerability scanning, and incident response, creating a smoother and more secure software development process. By leveraging AI/ML, the project aims to detect unusual activities, monitor logs and network traffic in real time, and automate security checks within CI/CD pipelines.
